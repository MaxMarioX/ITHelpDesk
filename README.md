IT-HELPDESK is a simple system for registering and managing notifications. Each system user has their own account with which they can create or close tickets or assign them to other users of the notification system. Each ticket has its own history, thanks to which the person currently responsible for the ticket has access to the activities performed earlier. The system also has an easy-to-use installer, thanks to which the implementation process is very fast.
